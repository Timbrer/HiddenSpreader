This is the Singapore data used in the paper. The picture is a network structure. The number of nodes in the edge file is the number of the patient (patient xxx) in the picture, and the numbers 1, 2, and 3 represent the three buildings that appear in the picture. The three columns of numbers in the History file are patient number, infection time (time of contact with the patient), admission time (PCR positive time). Among them, the infection time of the building is the infection time of the first person who entered the building, and the admission time is the admission time of the last person who entered the building. The time span in History1 is (24-71), that is, from January 24 to March 11, 2020, and in History2 is (11-51), that is, from February 11 to March 22, 2020.
